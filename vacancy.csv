					 Go Wombat — це команда талановитих спеціалістів, здебільшого сфокусованих на розробці стабільних і ефективних веб- та мобільних рішень. Ми любимо нестандартні задачі, що потребують застосування найсучасніших технологій. 

 Наші спеціалісти працюють у різних куточках світу, але ми дуже цінуємо живе спілкування. Більшість команди знаходиться в Україні, де розташовані основні офіси компаніі,- у Дніпрі та Івано-Франківську. 

 Основним напрямком нашого розвитку протягом останніх семи років є зростання без втрати технологічного фокусу, довкола якого і була збудована компанія. Єдиний напрямок діяльності у back-end — це Python та числені фреймворки, з яких в першу чергу ми працюємо з Django та FastAPI. На стороні front-end ми працюємо майже виключно з ReactJS. 

 Наша ієрархія дуже проста та еффективна, у нас немає бюрократії, і ми пишаємося цим!

Intetics,"Intetics Inc,  a leading global technology company providing custom software application development, distributed professional teams, software product quality assessment, and “all-things-digital” solutions, is seeking a talented Senior ML Engineer to join our team. Objective:  This project aims to develop a chatbot platform that serves as a centralized, trusted source of information for communities affected by the crisis in Ukraine. The chatbot will deliver critical, harmonized messages on humanitarian assistance, including details on cash and in-kind aid, fraud prevention, and contact information for relevant organizations. Key Features: Information Hub: The chatbot will provide affected individuals with access to essential information regarding humanitarian assistance options and resources, available on popular platforms — Telegram and Viber. User-Centric Design: Built to support both Ukrainian and English languages, the chatbot will include accessibility features for users with disabilities and will cater to a diverse audience, targeting up to 200,000 users in the first year. Scalability and Security: Hosted on a secure, scalable cloud infrastructure, the platform will implement robust security measures to protect user interactions and data. Content Management System (CMS): A custom CMS will enable non-technical staff to manage and update content, ensuring the chatbot remains current and relevant. Analytics and Monitoring: The platform will include a dashboard to monitor usage and user engagement, allowing continuous optimization based on real-time data. Timeline and Support:  The implementation time is up to 6 months, including planning, development, testing, and monitoring phases (+6 months in addition). Post-launch, the chatbot will undergo regular updates based on user feedback and data insights to ensure it meets ongoing humanitarian needs. Impact:  This chatbot will enhance access to humanitarian aid information for Ukrainians, supporting transparency, fraud prevention, and efficient resource navigation, and will play a vital role in the humanitarian response led by the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) and partners. Responsibilities: Chatbot Development and Architecture: Design and implement a secure chatbot platform using  Django (Python)  or  Node.js , ensuring scalability to support 200,000 users. Develop a one-way communication interface tailored for efficient information dissemination and anti-fraud messaging. Ensure compliance with WFP and humanitarian principles and guidelines, focusing on a user-friendly, accessible interface. User Interface and Accessibility: Create a chatbot interface that is intuitive, accessible, and inclusive of users with disabilities (e.g., voice speaker options, and special text). Implement language support for Ukrainian and English, ensuring localization and context relevance for Ukrainian users. Provide options for text and voice interaction to accommodate different user needs and preferences. Backend and Database Management: Set up and manage a scalable  PostgreSQL  database hosted on AWS, with automated backup and disaster recovery. Optimize the backend to handle high traffic, monitor performance, and integrate an analytics dashboard to track user behavior and chatbot effectiveness. Security and Data Protection: Implement robust security measures, including data encryption (AES-256), role-based access control (RBAC) to CMS, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to CMS. Ensure secure API integration with Telegram and Viber for messaging, implementing rate limiting and DDoS protection. API Integration: Integrate with  Telegram  and  Viber  APIs to facilitate platform accessibility and efficient information sharing. Implement Google TTS or similar services for voice responses to enhance accessibility for users who may prefer audio content. Content Management System (CMS): Develop a CMS with a user-friendly, WYSIWYG interface, allowing non-technical staff to manage content without altering the system code. Set up role-based access control within the CMS to limit content updates to authorized personnel only. Monitoring, Analytics, and Reporting: Set up real-time monitoring using AWS CloudWatch, tracking system performance, user interactions, and traffic patterns. Develop an analytical dashboard to track user behavior, chatbot interactions, and key metrics, integrating insights for potential future database integration. Testing, Rollout, and Maintenance: Define and execute testing phases, including user acceptance and bug resolution. Develop a demo and assist in the rollout process, implementing updates and improvements based on user feedback and analytics. Provide training for super users on content management and dashboard usage. Offer ongoing support for maintenance, ensuring regular updates and adjustments to meet user needs.
